      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi my name is Amanda Morgan and I have been an Elementary School Art Teacher for the past 5 years. I have very recently decided to do a career change at 30 years old. Alittle scary but also very exciting!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Alabama but grew up mostly in Tennessee.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Crochet - I even own an Etsy Shop called The Retro Stitch</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Watching the Food Network. I like to think of myself as a good cook.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to be a Web Developer for an Art Museum since my degree is in Art and Art History.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Calera, Alabama.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love being creative. That is why I became an Art Teacher however, I have realized that the Education World is not the best fit for me and I wanted something that was still creative but where I could work with adults. I took a free class on Website Development and fell in love with coding. Now, here I am.</p>
